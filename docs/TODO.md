* There is not enough variety in the questions. We need to generate a list of 100 possible dataset topics. Then for each prompt, we will have python randomly select one of these topics for Claude to use in its example dataset generation.
* When getting question from claude, it should also provide pandas and SQL answers. We should run these answers and verify they're giving us the same result dataset as claude provides. There should also be a button next to the problem info button to reveal this query.
* Add an easy skill for creating a derived column. This should be about creating a new column that is based on the value from another column or another set of columns. The possible types of derivations are: 1) arithmatetic (e.g. score=11-rank if rank is pre-existing column with values from 1-10). 2) simple conditional/boolean flag (is_passing = score >= 60), is_premium = tier in ['Gold', 'Platinum'] 3) very basic date manipulation (e.g. extract year from date or timestamp)
* Medium problems: These should be problems with 2-3 easy skills. When medium is selected, all easy skills will be possible. We want python to select the 2-3 skills to test, not Claude. When both `derive column` is selected with either `group by` or `where`, the `where` should often be on the derived column (or the aggegration from the group by should be on the dervied column). Also, the medium problems can require (or strongly benefit from) a single CTE, so maybe this should be a topic that can be selected for medium problems.
* Hard problems are similar to medium problems, but just a notch more. They will test 3-4 skills, but the bigger difference is that they should always require (or hugely benefit from) at least one CTE. Often hard problems should require 2-3 CTEs though. Hard problems can also test an advanced topic in docs/STUDY_GUIDE.md that's not alread covered by easy or medium (so there will likely be other topics that should be added to the selection for hard). When testing another advanced topic (e.g. wide to long), there is not a need to combine it with other topics. Python should be making these topic selections, not Claude. Do not worry about creating pandas dataframe from scratch for now as a topic.
