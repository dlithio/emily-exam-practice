Now shows the following in each of SQL/Pandas
1. Filter columns (select/df[[“col1”]])
2. Filter rows (where/df[df[“col1”]==“something”])
3a. Summarize rows/collapse groups of rows into single rows with calculations on other columns (group by/aggregate)
3b. Collapse groups of rows into single rows without calculations (distinct)
4. joins
5. Order by
6. limit

^ These are by far the most important things to drill yourself on

There are also some advanced topics covered in a similar way, but these have less bang for their buck.
7. Datatypes
8. CTEs (SQL only)
9. Cross joins
10. Creating pandas datagrams from scratch
11/12/13. Wide vs. Long tables and converting
